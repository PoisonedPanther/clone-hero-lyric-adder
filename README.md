# Clone Hero Lyric Adder

**REQUIRES PYTHON 3 INSTALLED**

Takes in a .chart with lyric events placed and a text file with lyrics, creates a new chart file with lyrics added.

## Usage
Format your text file with spaces after every syllable and formatted the way Clone Hero expects. Example:
```
Just a- ffects the ones a- round me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
I wish I could be the one
```
In the folder with the .chart file will be a new .chart file named `LYRIC<name>.chart`

## Troubleshooting
In the event of an error, the program should print out the error and wait for input. In this case, please message me on Discord at jpdown#0001, or create an issue here on this repo.
